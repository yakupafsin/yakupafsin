# 👋 Ahoy, Fellow Code Voyager! 🚀

Hello there! I'm Yakup, a software sorcerer based in the enchanting lands of Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿, originally from the magical realm of Turkey 🇹🇷. I specialize in the arcane arts of JavaScript, React Native, Expo, React, TypeScript, and various other spells from the mystical land of frameworks.

## 🧙‍♂️ Wizardry at Work

- 🚀 I'm on a quest to create pixel-perfect spells with React and React Native.
- 📱 Crafting magical mobile experiences with Expo and React Native.
- 💻 Turning TypeScript into my trusty spellbook for type-safe sorcery.

const me = {
